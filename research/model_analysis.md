# Fashion Classification Model Analysis

## Current Model Issues
- **google/vit-base-patch16-224**: Only 10 basic Fashion-MNIST categories (T-shirt, Trouser, Pullover, Dress, Coat, Sandal, Shirt, Sneaker, Bag, Ankle boot)
- Limited real-world applicability
- No confidence scores for predictions

## Potential Better Models

### 1. **adityavithaldas/fashion_category_classification**
- ‚úÖ Specialized for fashion classification
- ‚úÖ Likely has more detailed categories
- üîç Need to investigate category coverage

### 2. **Kr1n3/Fashion-Items-Classification**
- ‚úÖ Fashion-specific model
- üîç Need to check performance metrics
- üîç Category coverage unknown

### 3. **thilinadj/image_classification_tdj_fashion-mnist**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Still Fashion-MNIST based (limited categories)
- ‚ùå Same limitation as current model

## Recommended Approach

### Phase 1: Model Research & Selection
1. Test top 3 fashion classification models
2. Compare accuracy on real clothing images
3. Evaluate category coverage (aim for 50+ categories)

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features
1. **Multi-prediction API**: Return top 3-5 predictions with confidence scores
2. **Category expansion**: Support detailed clothing types (jeans, hoodie, blazer, etc.)
3. **Attribute detection**: Color, pattern, style detection

### Phase 3: API Improvements
1. **Batch processing**: Multiple images in single request
2. **Image preprocessing**: Auto-resize, format conversion
3. **Caching**: Model loading optimization
4. **Error handling**: Better validation and error messages

## Implementation Priority
1. ü•á Replace current model with specialized fashion classifier
2. ü•à Add confidence scores and top-K predictions
3. ü•â Expand to multi-attribute detection (color, style, etc.)
